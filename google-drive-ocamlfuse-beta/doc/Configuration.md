By default the configuration file is first created in `~/.gdfuse/default/config` (or `~/.gdfuse/label/config` if a label was specified on the command line). If the program is launched with the `-xdgbd` flag, however, the file is instead created in `~/.config/gdfuse/default/config` or `~/.config/gdfuse/label/config`; see [Configuration path priority](#configuration-path-priority) for more details.

The parser is very simple and only accepts lines in the form `key=value`, without spaces, comments, or anything else.

Google Drive supports multiple files with the same name. This flag specifies
the behavior of `mv`: When set to `false`, `mv` behaves in the standard way,
overwriting (trashing) the target file if it exists. When set to `true`, `mv`
will always keep the target file:

    keep_duplicates=false

Specifies whether to display file extensions for Google Docs:

    docs_file_extension=true

Specifies the maximum cache size in MB:

Specifies maximum upload speed per connection in bytes/second (`0` = unlimited):

    low_speed_limit=0
    low_speed_time=0

Specifies maximum number of retries after an error occurred (during a Drive API request):

    desktop_entry_exec=

[Since 0.7.1] Enable caching file writes in memory:

    write_buffers=false

### Document export formats

`desktop` format creates a shortcut to the document that will be opened in the web browser for edit.

If you don't want to export a specific kind of docs, just remove the format portion. For example, if you have this line in your `config` file:

    drawing_format=

no drawings will be exported.

Note that if you change any export format, you will have to clear the cache (using `-cc` command line option). Note also that this feature works only if you set `docs_file_extension=true`.

### Configuration path priority

The application reads or initializes its configuration according to the following logic:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdfuse/` is read if already existing;
2. Otherwise `$HOME/.gdfuse/` is read if already existing;
3. Otherwise `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdfuse/` is created, but only if the `-xdgbd` flag has been passed to the command;
4. Otherwise `$HOME/.gdfuse/` is created.

This is done in compliance with the [XDG Base Directory Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/).

The `xdg_base_directory` option in the `default/config` (or `label/config`) file acts independently from the mechanism above: if set to `true` (default with the `-xdgbd` flag), it tells the program to also use the `$XDG_DATA_HOME` and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` paths; if set to `false`, all the user's data will stay under the `gdfuse` directory, wherever it is located.
